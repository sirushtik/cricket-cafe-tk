# Cricket Match Ticket Booking System

## Overview

The Cricket Match Ticket Booking System is a GUI application built using Python's `tkinter` library. This application allows users to book tickets for a cricket match by selecting different seating blocks and calculates the total cost including taxes. The system also provides a receipt with booking details and options to interact with a separate `Cafe` module.
